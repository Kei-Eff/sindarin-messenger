# Sindarin Translator
CCC-2021 T2A3 - Networking Algorithm Application - Karl Alberto


# Project Details

## Description

This application is designed as a simple translator service that runs between a client and server. After establishing a connection between the client and server, the user is prompted to input a message they would like to translate. The user's message is then fed into a _Sindarin_ Translation API by the server. The server sends back that message in Sindarin (one of the _Elvish_ languages developed by J.R.R. Tolkien).
